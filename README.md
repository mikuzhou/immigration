# Project Work Summary

## Overview
In this project, we conducted a debate on two specific dates, September 27, 2023, and September 30, 2023. Our primary focus was on architecture and benchmark migration, and we explored various approaches to achieve this task. This README provides a brief summary of our work and the outcomes of our experiments.

## Dates of Debate
- September 27, 2023
- September 30, 2023

## Approach 1: Step-by-Step Guidance to GPT
### Objective
We aimed to migrate our benchmarks by providing GPT with specific instructions step by step.

### Process
1. We asked GPT to generate a `config.json` file that satisfied the conditions outlined in the README. 
2. GPT followed our instructions, and it worked successfully.

## Approach 2: Direct Interaction with GPT
### Objective
Our goal was to have GPT interact directly with our README and codebase.

### Process
1. We attempted to feed both the README and the codebase to GPT.
2. Unfortunately, this approach did not yield the desired results, and GPT was unable to work effectively.

## Approach 3: Adapting to a Sample Benchmark Code
### Objective
We wanted to adapt our code warehouse to match the structure of a sample benchmark code.

### Process
1. We provided a sample benchmark code to GPT and asked it to adjust our code accordingly.
2. GPT generated a new repository, but the changes did not align with our expectations. GPT primarily modified the `main.py` file, and it did not work as intended. It appeared that GPT struggled to arrange the code when fed only the README or template. Manual intervention and instructions were still necessary.

## Approach 4: README and Code Adjustment by GPT
### Objective
Our aim was to feed both the architecture README and benchmark code to GPT, allowing it to adjust the code to fit the specified architecture. Additionally, we requested GPT to rearrange the benchmark code and generate a new README to replace the old one.

### Process
1. We provided GPT with the architecture README and benchmark code.
2. GPT generated a new README and made significant changes to the `main.py` file.
3. While GPT's changes were substantial, they did not completely align with our expectations.

## Challenges
One challenge we encountered was integrating the GPT API key into our Git repository. GitHub has security measures in place to block any activities that expose API keys. This issue may require further attention in our future work.
